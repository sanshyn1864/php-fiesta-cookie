Watch the PHP Front to Back tutorials by Brad Traversy in this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJbfyzaA2QA&list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn

The repository named [traversy-effective-phpfiesta](https://github.com/PSU-BSCS3-CC6/traversy-effective-phpfiesta) in our GitHub organization contains all the codes created in this series. You can clone the repository and try to play with it.

As you progress in this YT series, try the following practice sets to hone your skills in writing PHP codes. To start, someone from your team will create a repository in your github account '**php-fiesta-cookie**'. Set your repo as **private**, so your answer would not be available in public. Next add your teammates and me as collaborator. Create a folder in your local machine with the same name as your repo.

 

Writing code is same as in academic writing, **when you use or adapt code** **developed by someone else as part of your project, you must cite your source**. Divide the tasks amongst your team. 

###### :space_invader: Practice 4-00

After watching the **Variables, Constants and Data Types** and **Arrays** write PHP code for this problem.

1. Inside /php-fiesta-cookie create a file named **01sa.php**

2. Create a multidimensional array named YourTeamName. Add the data below.

   | id   | species    | type1 | type2  | ability     | hp   | attack | defense |
   | ---- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
   | 1    | Bulbasaur  | Grass | Poison | Overgrow    | 45   | 49     | 49      |
   | 2    | Ivysaur    | Grass | Poison | Overgrow    | 60   | 62     | 63      |
   | 3    | Venusaur   | Grass | Poison | Overgrow    | 80   | 82     | 83      |
   | 4    | Charmander | Fire  | N/A    | Blaze       | 39   | 52     | 43      |
   | 5    | Charmeleon | Fire  | N/A    | Blaze       | 58   | 64     | 58      |
   | 6    | Charizard  | Fire  | Flying | Blaze       | 78   | 84     | 78      |
   | 7    | Squirtle   | Water | N/A    | Torrent     | 44   | 48     | 65      |
   | 8    | Wartortle  | Water | N/A    | Torrent     | 59   | 63     | 80      |
   | 9    | Blastoise  | Water | N/A    | Torrent     | 79   | 83     | 100     |
   | 10   | Caterpie   | Bug   | N/A    | Shield Dust | 50   | 20     | 55      |

3. Print the array

4. Echo the number of elements in an array.

5. Declare variable $favorite and assign your favorite specie (use array notation).



###### :space_invader: Practice 4-01

After watching the **Loops** write PHP code for this problem.

1. Using **foreach** display all the species in a list.
2. In CLI, git add, commit and push.



###### :space_invader: Practice 4-02

After watching the **Functions** write PHP code for this problem.

1. Inside /php-fiesta-cookie create another file named **02sa.php**
2. Create a function using this template hp_sum, ave_attack
   - hp_sum will return the sum of the column hp
   - ave_attack will return the average of column attack
3.  In CLI, git add, commit and push.



###### :space_invader: Practice 4-03

After watching the **Conditionals** write PHP code for this problem.

1. Inside /php-fiesta-cookie create another file named **03sa.php**

2. Create a function with this header **pokemon_defense**(arrayname, limit_number)
   - pokemon_defense function will echo the name of the pokemon with defense is greater than or equal to limit_number
3.  In CLI, git add, commit and push.



###### :space_invader: Practice 4-04

After watching the **Include and Require** clone the repository named [cover-verbose-memory](https://github.com/PSU-BSCS3-CC6/cover-verbose-memory) inside your **php-fiesta-cookie** folder.

1. Create folder a folder named 'inc' inside cover-verbose-memory.
2. Inside inc directory create file header.php, footer.php
3. Create pages for features, contacts (PHP files)
4. Modify the code in index.php
   -  separate the code for header and footer
   - to apply the separated files use include or require in index, features, contacts pages
5. In CLI, git add, commit and push
